#Movie Recommendation System

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a personalized movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. By leveraging collaborative filtering and content-based algorithms, the system provides tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences and movie attributes. The goal is to enhance user experience by offering relevant and engaging movie recommendations.

**Features:**

1)Personalized Recommendations: Utilizes user ratings and preferences to generate customized movie suggestions.

2)Collaborative Filtering: Analyzes user behavior and similarities to recommend movies that users with similar tastes have enjoyed.

3)Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity of movie attributes (e.g., genre, director, actors).

4)Dynamic Suggestions: Continuously updates recommendations based on new user data and interactions.



**Technologies Used:**

Python: Programming language used for development.

scikit-learn: Library for implementing machine learning algorithms.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical computing.

Surprise: Library for building and evaluating recommender systems
.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive development and experimentation.
